# Planet-States

This mod adds independent and sovereign planets for you to intereact with (or conquer), called Planet-States.

They can be thought of as Enclaves With Steroids: you can create a starbase in the system they are on, make some resource deals and get positive opinion with them if they are in your borders. Alternatively, they could also be seen as Micro Fallen Empires: the Planet-State Station that protects the planet is quite powerful and they posses quite advanced technology and awesome buildings - making their conquest quite profitable.

Right now the mod adds four Planet-States:
 * Fanatic Egalitarian: an ecumenopolis with 400 Pops. They trade Consumer Goods.
 * Fanatic Authoritarian: a slaver-state in a Tomb World. You can trade Minerals with them.
 * Fanatic Militarist: a society where all the heavy work is done by robots, while the organic pops dedicate themselves to fighting. They trade Alloys.
 * Fanatic Pacifist: a Gaia world inhabited by farmers that want to live in harmony with nature. They sell food.

If you have a high enough opinion with a Planet-State, you can sign a Commercial Pact with them. Each Commercial Pact gives you +5% Trade Value.

# Compatibility

I overwrite the game rule "can_take_hostile_actions". It should be compatible with any mod that doesn't overwrite the same rule.
