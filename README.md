This is the updated version of the Planet States mod originally made by [lpslucasps](https://github.com/lpslucasps).

I've decided to fork his repo and maintain the mod since he has been inactive for the last 16 months.
Contributions are welcome and encouraged.

This mod adds a bunch of independent, sovereign planets for you to interact with (or conquer), called Planet States.
These Planet States will spawn at the start of the game in random systems and will have random names.

## Fanatic Egalitarian

The Fanatic Egalitarian planet state has a lot of pops and will trade 1 Consumer Good for 2 Energy Credits.
You can decide to acquire monthly one of the following quantities:
  - 10;
  - 20;
  - 30;
  - 40;
  - 50;

You can also sign a Commercial Pact with them once you have good relations. The pact will increase your Trade Value by 5%.

## Fanatic Authoritarian

The Fanatic Authoritarian planet state is an slaver-state on a Tomb World.
They sell Minerals at a 1:1 rate in the following monthly quatities:
  - 10;
  - 20;
  - 30;
  - 40;
  - 50;

You can also sign a Commercial Pact with them once you have good relations. The pact will increase your Trade Value by 5%.

## Fanatic Militarist

The Fanatic Militarist planet state is a society where all the heavy work is done by robots, while the organic pops dedicate themselves to fighting.
This Planet State will sell you Alloys at a 1:4 rate in the following monthly quatities:

The Fanatic Pacifist planet state is a Gaia world inhabited by farmers that want to live in harmony with nature.
This Planet State will sell you Food at a 1:1 rate in the following monthly quatities:
